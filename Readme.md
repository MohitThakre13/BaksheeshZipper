# Baksheesh Cipher Analysis and Software Implementation

This repository contains an in-depth study and analysis of the **Baksheesh Cipher**, alongside a software implementation that demonstrates its practical use in encrypting and compressing folders. The software enables users to **zip and encrypt** folders as well as **decrypt and unzip** them securely.

## About the Baksheesh Cipher

The **Baksheesh Cipher** is a custom encryption technique that ensures data confidentiality and integrity. Our work includes:

- A thorough analysis of the cipher's principles, design, and security properties.
- An exploration of its strengths and areas of applicability in modern encryption scenarios.
- A practical implementation that highlights its real-world use.

---

## Software Implementation

The software implementation of the Baksheesh Cipher can be found in the `software` folder. It includes:

- **zipEncrypt.py**: Zips a folder and encrypts it using the Baksheesh Cipher.
- **decryptUnzip.py**: Decrypts the encrypted file and unzips it back to its original structure.
